JADX

## Step-by-Step Process

1. Setup & App Behavior Analysis

Installed Apk_task1 on an emulator.
Explored the user interface â€“ the app had no obvious flag or output.
Used adb logcat to view logs, nothing significant was output.
2. Identifying the Native Library

Decompiled the APK using APKTool and jadx.
Located native library: libnative-lib.so.
3. Listing Exported Functions

Run:
frida -U -n com.example.apk_task1 -e 'Module.enumerateExportsSync("libnative-lib.so").forEach(e => console.log(e.name))'
